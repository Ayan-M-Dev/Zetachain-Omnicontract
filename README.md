# Hardhat Template for ZetaChain

This is a simple Hardhat template that provides a starting point for developing
smart contract applications on ZetaChain.

# Origin of ZetaChain

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the rapid proliferation of novel decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications has ushered in a wave of innovation. However, this remarkable growth has been hampered by a critical challenge - the lack of seamless interoperability among diverse blockchain networks, faced by Layer 1 blockchains (L1) like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as Polygon and Arbitrum.

Developers are often faced with the daunting task of deploying and maintaining their decentralized applications (dApps) across multiple networks, each presenting its own set of challenges and limitations.

For users seeking to optimize their yields, the current landscape demands navigating through various dApps and traversing multiple bridges to transfer assets between networks.

This intricate process involves interacting with network-specific wrapped tokens and navigating different trust models, ultimately resulting in the fragmentation of overall liquidity and a cumbersome, expensive experience across numerous interfaces.

Despite the commendable efforts of numerous projects striving to address interoperability challenges, the persistent issue of fragmentation continues to impede progress, creating a maze of complexity for both users and developers. Enter ZetaChain, a groundbreaking solution poised to revolutionize the crypto landscape.

Applications built on ZetaChain offer a transformative approach, seamlessly connecting to every facet of the crypto ecosystem. This marks a paradigm shift in how developers and users interact with cryptocurrencies, consolidating various functionalities and services under a unified entry point.


# Overview of ZetaChain

ZetaChain is a public, decentralized Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK which is connected to different Layer 1s (Ethereum, BSC, Bitcoin and more) and Layer 2s solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism and more)!

One of ZetaChain's key strengths lies in its ability to facilitate seamless cross-chain and cross-layer value transfers, message passing, and smart contract calls. This opens up unprecedented possibilities for developers, who, for the first time, can now embark on creating omnichain applications.

These applications possess the remarkable capability to harness liquidity from multiple networks while effortlessly reading and updating states across all interconnected networks.

In essence, ZetaChain empowers developers to streamline their processes by deploying a single omnichain contract onto the ZetaChain platform. The revolutionary aspect here is that no additional contracts need to be deployed on the connected chains, ushering in a new era of simplicity and efficiency in decentralized application development.


Orchestrate assets all on one chain
The support for omnichain smart contracts on ZetaChain unleashes a realm of possibilities, marking the onset of a new wave of use cases and applications. This opens the floodgates to a diverse array of innovative solutions that can be seamlessly built on ZetaChain, revolutionizing the user experience and expanding the horizons of decentralized applications.
